      <p id="intro">
        I am Joseph Kernozek, a Senior Workforce Planning Consultant at The Hartford
        and an aspiring full-stack developer based in upstate New York.
      </p>
      <p>
        By day, I design data-driven solutions that help large operations teams
        make better decisions, building SQL and Snowflake datasets, creating
        Tableau dashboards, and turning messy spreadsheets into something
        leaders can actually use. I'm especially interested in automation and
        reporting workflows that reduce manual work and surface the right
        metrics at the right time.

        <li>Lantern Lines - Poetry Community (In Progress)</li>
        <p>Lantern Lines is a web platform concept for sharing poetry, reading others' work, and responding to curated prompts. It is my main “learning in public” project as I go deeper into modern web development.
Goals include user profiles, poem submissions, prompt-based challenges, and a warm, community-focused reading experience.
This project highlights skills in full-stack fundamentals, database modeling, authentication, API integration, and UI and UX design, with a focus on Next.js, React, Supabase, modern CSS or Tailwind, and deployment workflows.</p>
        <li>Midline - Distraction-Free Writing App for macOS (In Progress)</li>
        <p>Midline - Distraction-Free Writing App for macOS (In Progress)
Midline is a minimalist writing environment for fiction writers and journalers who want a clean, calm space to work. It is where I am leveling up my native app development skills.
Goals include a focused writing interface, simple project organization, and frictionless saving and export.
This project highlights skills in native macOS development, user experience design for writers, state management, and data persistence using Swift and SwiftUI.</p>
        <li>Workforce Planning Dashboards and Automation</li>
        <p>This is a collection of internal projects supporting workforce planning and reporting at The Hartford.
I build and refine SQL and Snowflake queries that feed dashboards and recurring reports.
I design Tableau views and Excel-based tools that help leaders understand volume, staffing, and performance trends.
I experiment with automation to reduce manual reporting and improve consistency.
These projects highlight skills in SQL, Snowflake, Tableau, Excel, KPI design, stakeholder communication, and process improvement.</p>
